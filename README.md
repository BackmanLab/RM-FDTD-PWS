# RM-FDTD-PWS

This folder contains the Angora configuration files used in the [ACS photonics paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.5c00311). The simulations were run on QUEST, the high performance computing facility at Northwestern University.

Angora is a free, open-source software available at [another repo](https://github.com/BackmanLab/AngoraFDTD).
